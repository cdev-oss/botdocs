## Verbatim
- In order to fully activate the bot, enabling all intents are required.
- Bot profile, bio, username, etc. is all customizable by you.
- Bot token is dangerous. Take care of it. Don't share it with anyone, aside cDev team.
- Your bot will be offline if you are about to reset the token.
- Our system are based on guild ID. Enabling Public Bot and use it for any purposes beside private usage wouldn't work.
